# The-Food-Delivery-System
 
 The functionalities involved in this system are :

Customers and Delivery Boys have separate logins to access their accounts.
Customers login into their account to place their food orders and based on their location it goes into corresponding delivery boy’s account.
Delivery Boys login into their account to view their orders which they need to deliver.
Customers can create their own login account using by clicking new registration.
Delivery Boys cannot create their account on their own. First they need to send their details and their resume to administrator. If we like his resume, we hire him and create a new account to him and share his login credentials to him through mail.
In customers account, they can delete their orders, view orders, update profile, view payments, etc..
In Delivery Boy’s account, they can view the orders they got and based on that, they will deliver the food and after delivering, they can update the delivery status in their account.
